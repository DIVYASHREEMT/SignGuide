# SignGuide: Real-Time Sign Language Recognition

**SignGuide** is a real-time sign language recognition system that uses a webcam and deep learning to detect and interpret hand gestures for alphabets and numbers. Designed to support individuals with speech and hearing impairments, it helps bridge communication gaps through gesture-based interaction.

## Features
- Detects and classifies hand gestures using a webcam
- Supports alphabets (A,B,C,E,F) and numbers (1,2,3,5,6)
- Real-time prediction and display of recognized gestures
- Built with TensorFlow/Keras and OpenCV
- Easy-to-use interface for testing and data collection

## Technologies Used
- **Python**
- **TensorFlow / Keras** – for training and loading the ML model (`keras_model.h5`)
- **OpenCV** – for webcam video capture and hand detection
- **NumPy** – for image preprocessing and array operations
